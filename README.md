# Epidemic-Simulation
An SIR Graph Model based simulation of an Epidemic I did as a Project in my freshman year.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Installation

Clone this project:
```
git clone https://github.com/angad11121/Epidemic-Simulation
```
### Parameters
Check Line [7-12] in [Epidemic SIR.c](./Epidemic%20SIR.c) and update values as required

### Compile and Run
```
make 
```
### Re-run with same parameters
```
./epidemic
```

## Output Format
Each line consists of 4 comma separated values:
`Day Number, Number Susceptible, Number Infected, Number Recovered`
